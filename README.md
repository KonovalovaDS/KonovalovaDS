## <center> My name is Natalia - passionate Data Scientist and Photography Enthusiast </center>

As a Data Scientist, I am passionate about working with data â€” from collection and cleaning to modeling and deployment â€” and applying **machine learning and AI techniques** to solve real-world problems.  
Currently pursuing an **MSc in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence** (graduating 2026), I enjoy bridging theory with practice by building scalable, impactful projects.

I am confident in working with **Python, SQL, PostgreSQL**, and have hands-on experience in:  
- **Machine Learning**: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Ensembles (RF, XGBoost, CatBoost), Neural Networks  
- **Big Data**: Modeling with **PySpark & Spark MLlib**  
- **APIs & Web Parsing**: Automated data extraction using **Requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium**  
- **Deployment**: ML pipelines with **FastAPI & Docker**  
- **EDA & Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, A/B testing, ANOVA, non-parametric tests  
- **Visualization**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SHAP  .


### Currently Learning
- Advanced **Deep Learning & Neural Networks**
- **LLMs and Generative AI** applications
- Best practices for **production-ready ML pipelines**
- Cloud tools for scalable data science
