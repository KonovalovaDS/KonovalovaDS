## <p align="center"> My name is Natalia - passionate Data Scientist and Photography Enthusiast 

In the past few years have worked as finance manager and sales executive in various industrial fields, but mainly in aviation maitenance area.

I believe that my analytical competence and strong communication qualities together with the knowledge and experience in data science field would allow my solid and steadfast interest in ML - modeling area not only to grow but also open a door to the new career path.

### So far have learned and made use of:

- Python, SQL;
- EDA, Feature Engineering and Data wrangling;
- Machine Learning;
- Mathematical statistics;
- ... *to be continued - learning every day*...
