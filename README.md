## <p align="center"> My name is Natalia - passionate Data Scientist and Photography Enthusiast </p>

As a Data Science Specialist, I am passionate about working with (big) data and applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Currently I am in the process to complete a Data Science program. I am confidently using the following libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy & Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Plotly and others. I know data structures, principles of OOP and modular programming; understand and use ML algorithms such as Linear & Logistics Regression, Decision Tree algorithm, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting, Clustering (k-means, DBSCAN).

The projects Iâ€™ve been working on can be reviewed below.

I am currently open for new opportunities in the data science field, where I can leverage my analytical skills, communication qualities, and domain expertise to create value and impact for the organization. I am eager to learn new technologies, collaborate with diverse teams, and contribute to the ML-developing area.

### So far have learned and made use of:

- Python, SQL;
- EDA, Feature Engineering and Data wrangling;
- Machine Learning;
- Mathematical statistics;
- Linear Algebra in the context of Linear Methods;
- Mathematical Analysis in the context of an optimization problem;
- ... *to be continued - learning every day*...
